# Custom-Linux-Shell-in-C
This project is a basic implementation of a custom shell (like bash) written in C. It mimics  the behavior of a Linux command-line interface by supporting:  1. Command execution (e.g., ls, pwd, date) 2. Built-in commands (cd, exit, history) 3. Background process execution (&amp;) 4. History tracking of commands
